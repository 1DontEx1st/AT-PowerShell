# Player ID is visible on your player profile (click the hero in the top left to see this)
# Finding your game auth token is slightly more involved. These directions are for using Google Chrome, but most browsers should be similar in functionality:
# 1. Open dev console (CTRL-Shift-i)
# 2. Click on "Console", then click on the Filter text box and enter "authentication" (without the quotes)
# 3. Login to game via web browser (https://www.kongregate.com/games/Throwdown/animation-throwdown)
# 4. You should see results below the filter showing your player ID and auth token
# 5. Plug those in above
